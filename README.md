Hi everyone. I´m Natán, a mathematical engineering student at @UC Chile whose primarily interest lies in the application of rigorous mathematical tools to the analysis and development of artificial intelligence, particularly in the areas of Alignment (RL), Interpretability (Mech Interp) and Governance and societal implications of AI. This page is currently not up to date and ordered, but soon will contain fun projects and research. Stay tuned!
